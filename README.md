# Data Modeling with Python and Postgres

## Introduction
In this project, I analyzed the data collected by Sparkify – a startup company – to understand the song the users were listening to. Given a directory of JSON user activity on the music app as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their apps. I created a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on the song play analysis. I thus started by creating database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. I was able to test the database and ETL pipeline by executing the queries given by the analytics teams from the company and was able to compare the results obtained.
